# Songuess Chrome extension

The extension is used for hosting Songuess games.

The currently supported streaming services:
* Google Play Music
* Spotify
* Youtube Music

## Installing

1. [Download](https://github.com/tgrbin/songuess_chrome_extension/archive/master.zip) (or clone) the extension
2. Unzip it
3. Go to chrome://extensions, enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and choose the extension folder

## Create a room

Go to https://songuess.live/#newRoom and create a room.

## Create a playlist

Go to your streaming service web page in another tab and create a playlist you want to host a game with.

## Start the game

From the streaming service page tab, click on the extension icon (SG icon, upper right, could be hidden), type the room name and click "Start the game".

The music should start coming from the songuess tab! Refrain from touching the streaming service page, as it may conflict with what the extension is doing.

## Have fun playing! :)

## Issues

You can stop/start the game if there are any problems, it should continue normally.

If the server crashes, you'll have to contact me to restart manually.

We only tested the game in Chrome.
