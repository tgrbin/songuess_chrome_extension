# Songuess Chrome extension

The extension is used for hosting Songuess games.

The only currently supported streaming service is Google Play Music, but we can add more when someone asks for it.

## Installing

1. [Download](https://github.com/tgrbin/songuess_chrome_extension/archive/master.zip) (or clone) the extension
2. Unzip it
3. Go to chrome://extensions, enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and choose the extension folder

## Create a room

Go to https://songuess.live/#newRoom and create a room.

## Create a playlist

Go to your streaming service web page in another tab and create a playlist you want to host a game with.

## Start the game

The game is started by "attaching" the extension to the created server room.

For Google Play Music, you probably want your playlist to shuffle, so click "Shuffle" (and then pause) or have the shuffle icon enabled before attaching.

From the streaming service page tab, click on the extension icon (SG icon, upper right, could be hidden), type the room name and click "Attach".

The music should start coming from the songuess tab! Refrain from touching the streaming service page, as it may conflict with what the extension is doing.

## Have fun playing! :)

## Issues

You can detach/attach if there are any problems, the game should continue normally.

If the server crashes, you'll have to contact me to restart manually.

We only tested the game in Chrome.
